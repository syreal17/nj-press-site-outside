      <p>Established in 2025, the NJ Press seeks to encourage souls on their 
        pilgrimage to New Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>We're a small, contemplative imprint dedicated to publishing works
          that explore the sacred in unexpected places. We believe that poetry, 
          prayer, and reflection are not confined to ancient texts or stone
          sanctuariesâ€”but are also found in streetlights, loading screens, 
          browser tabs, and quiet kitchen tables.</p>

        <p>Our mission is to awaken readers to the nearness of the divine,
          especially in the digital and the mundane. We publish books that are
          spiritually resonant, intellectually honest, and lit with a little
          fire.</p>

        <p> To support us, you can donate at
          <a href="https://www.patreon.com/syreal" target="_blank">Patreon</a>,
          buy our books on Amazon, or download our free PDF's and give them to
          anyone you think would enjoy them. May you feel God's presence closer
          everyday!</p>
